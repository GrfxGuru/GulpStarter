I am slowly moving over to using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for improving my Web and JavaScript workflows. This repository is my starting set of tasks that I expect to use over and over again. It also serves as a learning repository for me as I study Gulp. I am certain these tasks will expand and improve over time as I find more reasons to automate my process.

Feel free to use or suggest improvements to these tasks in the spirit of sharing with others. You can also contact me via my web site, [https://peterwitham.com](https://peterwitham.com).
